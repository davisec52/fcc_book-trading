Objective: Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: http://bookjump.herokuapp.com/ and deploy it to Heroku.

Note that for each project, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new Heroku project. If you can't remember how to do this, revisit https://freecodecamp.org/challenges/get-set-for-our-dynamic-web-application-projects.

Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:

User Story: I can view all books posted by every user.

User Story: I can add a new book.

User Story: I can update my settings to store my full name, city, and state.

User Story: I can propose a trade and wait for the other user to accept the trade.


For the purposes of this challenge I used the Google book api to source book results. The passwordless
login is managed by the passwordless plugin found at https://www.npmjs.com/package/passwordless. I created a free email address using outlook.live.com. I found this workable for development, but outlook
is slow and finnecky with regard to use. 

A working version of this project can be found on heroku at http://fcc-book-ex-app.herokuapp.com
